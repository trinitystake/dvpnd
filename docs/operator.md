# Running a dvpnd node

What you need: a Linux host (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 or Debian 12/13, x86_64) with a **public IPv4
address** (a home connection behind carrier-grade NAT will not work — check that your
router's WAN address is not in 100.64.0.0/10), root access, and an account on the Sentinel
chain holding a little DVPN for gas. Registration deposit is currently 0.

This guide covers WireGuard, AmneziaWG, OpenVPN, V2Ray, XRAY and Hysteria2 nodes; the
protocol is chosen with `[node] type`. A WireGuard node has been run this way against the
public network with real clients; AmneziaWG, OpenVPN, XRAY and Hysteria2 nodes served their
protocol's own client end to end on a test machine; the V2Ray path is documented from the
code and has not been exercised end to end yet.

## Which way to run it

Run the node on the host as a systemd service (§6), on a VPS that does nothing else. Use
Docker (§7) only when the host path does not fit: you want the bundled `v2ray` and `hnsd`
without installing them, you cannot put a Go toolchain on the host, or everything on that
host already runs in Docker.

The reason is where the protocol's data plane lives. A **WireGuard**, **AmneziaWG** or
**OpenVPN** node creates a tunnel interface on the host and NATs the peers' traffic out of
the uplink: on the host that is one
NAT hop with native IPv6; in a container it is two NAT hops, IPv6 needs a Docker daemon
change, and the container has to be given NET_ADMIN, SYS_MODULE and the host's kernel modules
anyway, so the isolation is nominal. A **V2Ray**, **XRAY** or **Hysteria2** node is a userspace
proxy on one port with no privileges at all: host and Docker are equal, and the host wins only
for having one way of running things across node types.

Whichever way: a dedicated machine with its own IP. The node runs as root, keeps an
unencrypted key, and routes strangers' traffic out of that IP, so abuse complaints land there.
Never on a validator host, never next to anything with secrets.

## 1. Build

Build on the host (cgo is needed for sqlite, so cross-compiling is awkward; there is no
binary release yet):

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git build-essential
# Go 1.26 or newer: https://go.dev/dl/  (apt's may be too old)
git clone <this repository> dvpnd && cd dvpnd      # or copy the source tree over
make build && sudo install -m 0755 bin/dvpnd /usr/local/bin/dvpnd
dvpnd version
```

## 2. Configuration

```sh
dvpnd config init                     # writes ~/.dvpnd/config.toml (run as root: the node runs as root)
```

Edit `~/.dvpnd/config.toml`:

| Key | Set to |
|---|---|
| `[keyring] backend` | `test` — the node must sign transactions unattended, so the key is stored unencrypted under `~/.dvpnd/keyring-test` (mode 700). Use a **dedicated operator key** and sweep earnings out regularly; see §8. |
| `[keyring] from` | the key name you will create in step 3, e.g. `operator` |
| `[node] type` | `wireguard`, `amneziawg`, `openvpn`, `v2ray`, `xray` or `hysteria2`; see §2a to §2f for the protocol's own file |
| `[node] moniker` | your node's public name (4–32 characters) |
| `[node] gigabyte_prices` | e.g. `40000000udvpn` (40 DVPN per GB). Only denoms the chain lists in its node params are accepted; prices below the chain's minimums are rejected at registration. |
| `[node] hourly_prices` | e.g. `97500000udvpn` |
| `[node] remote_url` | `https://<public-ip>:8585` — this becomes the on-chain `remote_addrs` (`host:port`); clients connect to it directly |
| `[node] listen_on` | `0.0.0.0:8585` |
| `[handshake] enable` | `false` unless you install `hnsd` (Handshake DNS resolver); must be `false` on a proxy node (V2Ray, XRAY, Hysteria2) |
| `[geoip]` | Leave `provider = "auto"`: at start the node asks ipwho.is, then ip2location.io, for the location of its public IP and cross-checks the country against Cloudflare; a disagreement is logged. No key, no cost, and both services allow commercial use on their free tier. Check the result with `curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:8585/status \| jq .result.location` (`source` names the service that answered). The location a node reports is self-declared and nothing verifies it; clients use it to choose a node, so only if the lookup is wrong set `city`, `country` (name or ISO code), `latitude`, `longitude` to the server's real physical location. The node logs the contradiction and reports `source = "static"`. Do not use `ip-api` on a node that earns unless you pay for it: its free tier is non-commercial only (a paid key goes in `url`). `ipinfo` returns the country only on its free plan. |
| `[bandwidth]` | Leave both at `0`: at start the node measures its link. It picks speed test servers by measured latency, discards any that answer from inside its own datacenter (common on cloud hosts: those measure the local network and can overstate the link several times over), and reports the lowest of two or three independent servers. That takes one to two minutes and moves several gigabytes on a fast link; the result is kept in `~/.dvpnd/bandwidth.json` and reused for a week, or until the public IP changes (delete the file to measure again). If you know what your provider sells you, set `download_mbps` and `upload_mbps` (a 1 Gbit/s port is `1000`) and the measurement is skipped. See which you got with `curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:8585/status | jq .result.bandwidth`: `source` is `speedtest`, `config` or `none`. Nothing verifies the figure and clients use it to choose a node: do not overstate it. |
| `[chain] rpc_addresses` | comma-separated, tried in order; the defaults are public endpoints from the [chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/sentinel/chain.json). Put your own RPC first if you run one. An endpoint that answers with an HTTP redirect does not work with this client. |

Geolocation services: ipwho.is and Cloudflare require no attribution. dvpnd uses IP2Location.io
IP geolocation web service.

### 2a. WireGuard

```sh
dvpnd wireguard config init           # writes ~/.dvpnd/wireguard.toml
```

Pick a fixed `listen_port` (the default is random) and keep it — it is what clients are told
to connect to. `uplink` may stay empty; the interface of the default route is detected at
start and used for NAT. `enable_ipv6` is `true`, as on every other node: the host must then
reach the IPv6 internet (check in §6; Docker needs extra steps, §7). Set it `false` for an
IPv4-only tunnel; clients then exit with the node's IPv4 address only.

### 2b. V2Ray

```sh
dvpnd v2ray config init               # writes ~/.dvpnd/v2ray.toml
```

Pick a fixed `listen_port` (TCP). `transport = "tcp"` is the only transport confirmed with
current client apps. `tls = true` wraps the VMess inbound in TLS using the node's
`tls.crt`/`tls.key` from §4 and advertises the certificate's pin to clients; `false` relies
on VMess's own encryption. The node needs the `v2ray` binary on `PATH` (see §6) and drives it
over loopback port 23, so nothing else on the host may bind that port.

### 2c. XRAY

```sh
dvpnd xray config init                # writes ~/.dvpnd/xray.toml with a fresh REALITY key pair
```

One VLESS inbound on `[vless] listen_port` (TCP; pick a fixed one). `security` chooses how
it is wrapped:

- `tls` (default): the node's `tls.crt`/`tls.key` from §4; clients receive the certificate's
  pin in the handshake and connect to nothing else.
- `reality`: no certificate. The node imitates the TLS handshake of `[reality] server_name`,
  so to an observer the port looks like that site. The site must serve TLS 1.3 with HTTP/2
  on port 443 and answer with a small certificate chain: `www.apple.com` (the default) and
  `www.cloudflare.com` work with current xray, `www.microsoft.com` does not. The key pair
  and `short_id` are generated by `config init`; clients receive the public key, short id,
  server name and `fingerprint` in the handshake. Only change the keys with a fresh
  `config init --force`.

`flow = true` enables XTLS Vision, which current clients support and expect. The node drives
xray over loopback `[api] port`; nothing else may bind it. Destinations in private and
loopback ranges are blocked for clients, so a client cannot reach that port or anything else
on the host through the proxy. The node needs the `xray` binary on `PATH` (see §6).

### 2d. Hysteria2

```sh
dvpnd hysteria2 config init           # writes ~/.dvpnd/hysteria.toml
```

One QUIC listener on `[server] listen_port` (UDP; pick a fixed one), always wrapped in TLS
with the node's `tls.crt`/`tls.key` from §4; clients receive the certificate's pin in the
handshake and refuse to connect without it. `obfs_password` turns on Salamander obfuscation
with that password, which clients receive in the handshake; empty means none. `up`/`down`
cap what each client gets (e.g. `"100 mbps"`); empty lets the client choose. Clients
authenticate with their session's UUID: the server asks the node on loopback `[api]
auth_port` for every new connection, and the node reads usage from the server's statistics
API on `[api] stats_port`; nothing else may bind those ports. The node needs the `hysteria`
binary on `PATH` (see §6). On a host the node raises the kernel's UDP buffer limits
(`net.core.rmem_max`, `wmem_max`) at start, which QUIC wants; in Docker set them on the host.

### 2e. AmneziaWG

```sh
dvpnd amneziawg config init           # writes ~/.dvpnd/amneziawg.toml with fresh obfuscation parameters
```

WireGuard with obfuscation: the same keys as `wireguard.toml` (interface `awg0`, a fixed
`listen_port`, `uplink`, `enable_ipv6`, all as in §2a) plus an `[obfuscation]` section that
`config init` fills: junk packets the node sends before a handshake (`jc`, `jmin`, `jmax`;
each side has its own), padding on the handshake messages (`s1`, `s2`; `s3`, `s4` stay 0 so
the tunnel keeps its MTU), and four message type values replacing WireGuard's (`h1`–`h4`).
Clients receive `s1`–`s4`, `h1`–`h4` and any signature packets `i1`–`i5` in the handshake and
must match them; change them only with a fresh `config init --force`, which disconnects every
client. The node needs `awg` and `awg-quick` on `PATH` and either the AmneziaWG kernel module
or `amneziawg-go` (see §6).

### 2f. OpenVPN

```sh
dvpnd openvpn config init             # writes ~/.dvpnd/openvpn.toml
```

Interface `ovpn0`, a fixed `listen_port`, `proto = "udp"` (recommended) or `"tcp"`,
`uplink` and `enable_ipv6` as in §2a, and `[management] port`, a loopback port over which
the node admits clients and reads their traffic; nothing else may bind it. The node is its
own certificate authority: on the first start it creates a CA, a server certificate and a
tls-crypt key under `~/.dvpnd/openvpn/` (keep them: they persist across restarts, and a
client's profile embeds the CA and the tls-crypt key), and it issues every session its own
client certificate and key, valid for a week, which the client presents. A connecting
certificate is admitted only while its session is registered; removing a peer kills its
connection and denies the certificate from then on. The node needs the `openvpn` binary on
`PATH` (see §6).

## 3. Key

```sh
dvpnd keys add operator                # prints the mnemonic once: store it safely
dvpnd keys add operator --recover      # or import an existing mnemonic
dvpnd keys list                        # shows the sent1… operator and sentnode1… node address
```

Send a few DVPN to the `sent1…` address for gas (each status update and usage report is a
transaction; budget roughly 0.02 DVPN per transaction, a status update every 48 minutes).

## 4. TLS certificate

Clients pin the certificate per session, so a self-signed one is what the network expects:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 -nodes -days 3650 \
  -subj "/CN=dvpnd" -keyout ~/.dvpnd/tls.key -out ~/.dvpnd/tls.crt
```

## 5. Firewall and forwarding

| Node type | Port | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| all | `[node] listen_on`, 8585 above | tcp |
| wireguard | `listen_port` in `wireguard.toml` | udp |
| amneziawg | `listen_port` in `amneziawg.toml` | udp |
| openvpn | `listen_port` in `openvpn.toml` | `proto` in `openvpn.toml` |
| v2ray | `listen_port` in `v2ray.toml` | tcp |
| xray | `listen_port` in `xray.toml` | tcp |
| hysteria2 | `listen_port` in `hysteria.toml` | udp |

```sh
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH && sudo ufw allow 8585/tcp && sudo ufw allow <listen_port>/udp && sudo ufw enable
```

WireGuard, AmneziaWG and OpenVPN only: peer traffic is NAT-ed through the uplink interface. The node enables
`net.ipv4.ip_forward` and `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding` itself when it brings the interface
up, and it accepts established replies back into the tunnel itself, so a FORWARD policy of
DROP (ufw's default, or a host where Docker is or was installed) is fine. Ports published by
Docker bypass ufw: on a Docker host the ufw rules above only protect what is not published.

## 6. Run as a service (recommended)

Before the first start, install what the protocol needs on the host:

- **WireGuard:** `sudo apt-get install -y wireguard-tools`. Every kernel since 5.6 has the
  module. With `enable_ipv6 = true` the host must reach the IPv6 internet:
  `ping -6 -c1 2606:4700:4700::1111` from the host must answer, otherwise set it `false`.
  No sysctl or daemon change: the node turns forwarding on at every start.
- **AmneziaWG:** `awg` and `awg-quick` from
  [amneziawg-tools](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-tools) (v1.0.20260618-2, the
  version current client apps bundle), built from source: `git clone`, `git checkout
  v1.0.20260618-2`, `make -C src && sudo make -C src install` (needs `build-essential`,
  `bash`, `iproute2`). Then the data plane, one of: the kernel module from
  [amneziawg-linux-kernel-module](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-linux-kernel-module)
  via DKMS (kernel headers needed, rebuilt on every kernel update; fastest), or
  [amneziawg-go](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-go) at tag v0.2.19 (`go build -o
  /usr/local/bin/amneziawg-go .`), which `awg-quick` uses when the module is absent. The
  node refuses to start when the tools are missing. Everything about IPv6 under WireGuard
  applies.
- **OpenVPN:** `sudo apt-get install -y openvpn` (2.6 or newer; Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04
  ship it). With a kernel that has the `ovpn` data channel offload module (6.16 and newer,
  or the DKMS package) OpenVPN uses it on its own; without it the data plane runs in
  userspace, which is fine. The node refuses to start when the binary is missing.
- **V2Ray:** the `v2ray` binary (v5) on `PATH`. Download `v2ray-linux-64.zip` from the
  [v2fly/v2ray-core releases](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/releases), unzip it and
  `sudo install -m 0755 v2ray /usr/local/bin/v2ray`; `v2ray version` must work. The Docker
  image bundles Alpine's package; `docker run --rm dvpnd v2ray version` shows that version if
  you want to match it. The node refuses to start when the binary is missing.
- **XRAY:** the `xray` binary on `PATH`, release 26.3.27, the version current client apps
  bundle and the one the Docker image pins. Download `Xray-linux-64.zip` from the
  [XTLS/Xray-core release](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v26.3.27),
  check it against the `.dgst` file published next to it, unzip only the binary and
  `sudo install -m 0755 xray /usr/local/bin/xray`; `xray version` must work. The node
  refuses to start when the binary is missing.
- **Hysteria2:** the `hysteria` binary on `PATH`, release app/v2.10.0, the version current
  client apps bundle and the one the Docker image pins. Download `hysteria-linux-amd64`
  from the [apernet/hysteria release](https://github.com/apernet/hysteria/releases/tag/app%2Fv2.10.0),
  check it against `hashes.txt` published next to it, and
  `sudo install -m 0755 hysteria-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/hysteria`; `hysteria version`
  must work. The node refuses to start when the binary is missing.

Then:

```sh
sudo cp scripts/dvpnd.service /etc/systemd/system/dvpnd.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now dvpnd
journalctl -u dvpnd -f
```

First start: the node measures its link unless `[bandwidth]` declares it (one to two minutes
and several gigabytes, then reused for a week), registers (`MsgRegisterNode`),
marks itself active (`MsgUpdateNodeStatus`), starts its service (`wg0` up, or the proxy as a
child process) and serves `https://<ip>:8585`. Check it:

```sh
curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:8585/ | head -c 400            # {"success":true,"result":{"service_type":"wireguard",…}}
```

On the chain, the node appears in `sentinel/node/v3/nodes/<sentnode1…>` with status
`active`. Node aggregators that client apps read re-probe active nodes every few minutes;
once your `GET /` answers from the internet your node becomes visible in the apps.

The node adapts its cadence to the chain: it never lets `interval_update_status` or
`interval_update_sessions` exceed 80% of the chain's `status_timeout` parameters (a silent
node is deactivated by the chain after that timeout; a session that reports nothing is
cancelled).

`systemctl stop` or `restart` sends SIGTERM; the node stops its service first (tunnel down
and NAT rules removed, or the proxy child exited) and exits. Connected peers are dropped
and reconnect on their own; the session database is kept and reconciled with the chain at
the next start. A client that reconnects keeps its on-chain session, and the node keeps
reporting that session's totals on top of what the chain already holds (the chain refuses a
report lower than the last one, and one refused report fails the whole batch).

## 7. Run with Docker (when the host path does not fit)

Use this when you want the bundled `v2ray`, `xray`, `hysteria`, `openvpn`, AmneziaWG tools
and `hnsd`, cannot install Go on the host, or the host already runs everything in Docker. Build the image (the Dockerfile uses BuildKit cache
mounts, so BuildKit must be on — it is by default on current Docker; otherwise prefix the
command with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`):

```sh
make build-image                    # docker build ... --tag dvpnd
```

**IPv6 (WireGuard nodes).** The tunnel is dual-stack by default (`enable_ipv6 = true` in
`wireguard.toml`), so the node must reach the IPv6 internet, otherwise every IPv6 connection
a client opens through the tunnel is answered with "unreachable"; browsers fall back to IPv4
but other software may fail. On Docker's default bridge a container cannot reach IPv6, so
either set `enable_ipv6 = false` for an IPv4-only tunnel, or give containers IPv6 with
`/etc/docker/daemon.json` and a Docker restart (a running container restarts with it):

```json
{
  "ipv6": true,
  "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00:d0c:1::/64",
  "ip6tables": true
}
```

```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker run --rm alpine ping -6 -c1 2606:4700:4700::1111   # optional: a reply means containers reach IPv6
```

Docker enables IPv6 forwarding on the host itself, so no sysctl change is needed. If the
check fails and the host has no IPv6 connectivity at all, set `enable_ipv6 = false` instead.
Docker NATs the container's IPv6 to the host's address, so with IPv6 on, clients exit with
the host's IPv6 address on IPv6-capable sites. A V2Ray container without IPv6 only fails
for IPv6-only destinations, which are rare. `scripts/runner.sh setup` writes its own
`daemon.json` and overwrites an existing one.

**Configuration.** The image is named `dvpnd` and its entrypoint binary is `process`; the
command after the image name is passed to the node. Prepare `config.toml`, the protocol's
file, the key and `tls.crt`/`tls.key` in `/root/.dvpnd` exactly as in sections 2 to 4 (run
the host binary, or `docker run --rm -v /root/.dvpnd:/root/.dvpnd dvpnd process config init`).
The container runs as root, so those files must be root-owned.

**WireGuard node:**

```sh
docker run --detach --name dvpnd --restart unless-stopped \
  --log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=3 \
  --volume /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
  --volume /root/.dvpnd:/root/.dvpnd \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE --cap-add NET_RAW --cap-add SYS_MODULE \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1 \
  --publish 8585:8585/tcp \
  --publish <listen_port>:<listen_port>/udp \
  dvpnd process start
```

The container drops every capability except the four WireGuard needs. IP forwarding is passed
in with `--sysctl` because `/proc/sys` is read-only inside an unprivileged container: the node
reads those switches and, finding them already on, leaves them alone. Publish the same UDP
port as `wireguard.toml`'s `listen_port`.

**AmneziaWG node:** the image carries `amneziawg-go` and the tools, so the tunnel runs in
userspace on a tun device; a kernel module cannot be loaded from an image. The WireGuard
command with `amneziawg.toml`'s `listen_port`, `--device /dev/net/tun` instead of the
`/lib/modules` volume, and without `--cap-add SYS_MODULE`:

```sh
docker run --detach --name dvpnd --restart unless-stopped \
  --log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=3 \
  --device /dev/net/tun \
  --volume /root/.dvpnd:/root/.dvpnd \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE --cap-add NET_RAW \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1 \
  --publish 8585:8585/tcp \
  --publish <listen_port>:<listen_port>/udp \
  dvpnd process start
```

**OpenVPN node:** the AmneziaWG command above with `openvpn.toml`'s `listen_port` published
as `/udp` or `/tcp` to match `proto`. The tun device and NET_ADMIN are what OpenVPN needs;
the data channel runs in userspace inside the container.

**V2Ray node:**

```sh
docker run --detach --name dvpnd --restart unless-stopped \
  --log-opt max-size=50m --log-opt max-file=3 \
  --volume /root/.dvpnd:/root/.dvpnd \
  --cap-drop ALL --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  --publish 8585:8585/tcp \
  --publish <listen_port>:<listen_port>/tcp \
  dvpnd process start
```

No modules, no sysctls, no NET_ADMIN: the proxy is a plain process on a port. Publish the
same TCP port as `v2ray.toml`'s `listen_port`.

**XRAY node:** the same command with `xray.toml`'s `listen_port`. The image pins xray
26.3.27 and checks its sha256 at build time.

**Hysteria2 node:** the same command with `hysteria.toml`'s `listen_port` published as
`/udp`, and `sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216 net.core.wmem_max=16777216` on the
host (persist it under `/etc/sysctl.d/`), since a container cannot raise them. The image
pins hysteria app/v2.10.0 and checks its sha256 at build time.

The `--log-opt` flags cap the container's log at three files of 50 MB; Docker's default
json-file log grows without bound. `scripts/runner.sh` wraps these commands (`init`, `start`,
`stop`, `status`, `update`) for every node type; edit its `NODE_IMAGE` if you push the image
to a registry.

The WireGuard path is exercised by an end-to-end test that builds the image, registers a
node, buys a session and connects a client from a second container — a WireGuard node served
real traffic this way and reported it on chain.

## 8. Operating

- **Logs:** `journalctl -u dvpnd` on the host, `docker logs dvpnd` in Docker. Every
  transaction logs its hash and code.
- **Advertised bandwidth:** `curl -sk https://127.0.0.1:8585/status | jq .result.bandwidth`
  shows the figure and its `source`. `speedtest` is a measurement; the log has one
  `Speed test result` line per server used, and a `rejected: too close to be off this host's
  network` line for every server that answered from inside the datacenter (those would have
  reported the local network). `config` is the `[bandwidth]` setting. `none` with zeros means
  no measurement was possible: every reachable speed test server was inside this host's
  network, or the speed test service was unreachable and nothing was cached. The node runs
  regardless; declare the link in `[bandwidth]` or restart once the service is back.
- **Earnings** accrue to the operator `sent1…` address as sessions settle. Sweep them to a
  wallet you hold offline; the key on the node is unencrypted.
- **Upgrade:** on the host, build the new version, `sudo systemctl stop dvpnd`, install the
  binary, `sudo systemctl start dvpnd`. In Docker, rebuild or pull the image, `docker rm -f
  dvpnd` and rerun the run command. Existing peers are dropped on restart; the local session
  database (`data.db`) is kept and reconciled with the chain.
- **Moving hosts:** copy `~/.dvpnd` (keyring, config, TLS, protocol file) to the new host and
  change `remote_url`; the next start sends `MsgUpdateNodeDetails` with the new address.
- **Stopping for good:** `sudo systemctl disable --now dvpnd`. The chain marks the node
  inactive after `status_timeout` (currently 1 h) without an update; to do it immediately run
  `go run ./tools/e2e -home /root/.dvpnd -deactivate` from the source tree.
- **Upstream node data:** if this host ran the upstream node, its files are in
  `~/.sentinelnode`; `dvpnd` never reads them but prints a hint when only that directory exists.
